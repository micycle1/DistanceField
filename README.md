# DistanceField

ðŸš§Repo & code under constructionðŸš§

Visualises distance fields for 2D shapes (in Processing).

In this library a distance field defines, for every point (pixel) in a shape, the euclidean distance between it and a single origin point.
Note this is unlike a *signed distance function*, which defines for every point the shortest distance to the shape's boundary.

### Example

### Technique
* Triangulate the shape (with refinement) using the shape's *(x, y)* vertices.
* Model the triangulation as a graph; compute the shortest path distance from a given origin vertex to every other vertex.
* Retriangulate the vertices (now *(x, y, z)*, where z is the corresponding shortest path distance).
* Apply an interpolator to the new triangulation, which produces an interpolated distance value for each pixel. 3 different interpolators are provided (offering a speed-quality tradeoff).
